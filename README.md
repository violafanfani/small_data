# SMALL DATA

### Repo for the summer school course on Learning with Small Data.
### University of Essex, August 2019

This repo contains the notebooks and python scripts for the afternoon labs of the
Learning from Small Data course.

**Hierarchical model example**:https://github.com/fonnesbeck/multilevel_modeling

**Notebook 1**: Intro to PyMC3, linear and non-linear regression, first models
and basic exercises.

**Notebook 2**: Hierarchical models. Theory in https://docs.pymc.io/notebooks/multilevel_modeling.html, based on Gelman and Hill 2006. Data from BIAS project
http://www.bias-project.org.uk/WB2011Man/CourseData/BHMData.zip.

**Notebook 3**: more complex exercises from the book http://camdavidsonpilon.github.io/Probabilistic-Programming-and-Bayesian-Methods-for-Hackers/


## General Resources

**Bayesian Methods for Hackers**

**Adapted companion repo of BDA3**
https://github.com/pymc-devs/resources/tree/master/BDA3
Bayesian Data Analysis is the 'bible' of Bayesian thinking. Although those notebooks are not fully detailed, they are a great way to follow what is done in the book and the state of the art of the field.

**Repo of Statistical Rethinking**
https://github.com/pymc-devs/resources/tree/master/Rethinking
Again, these notebooks are not the best documented, but they make really easy following the examples in the book.

**Repo for Doing Bayesian Data Analysis**

Examples from the Krushke book adapted to PyMC3.
